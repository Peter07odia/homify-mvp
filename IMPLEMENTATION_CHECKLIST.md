- [ ] Add sound alerts for completion (optional)

---

## Phase 5: Gallery & Camera Access üì∏

### Mobile Expo Go Compatibility
- [x] Ensure robust camera access on mobile devices
- [x] Fix gallery permissions and image selection
- [ ] Test camera functionality on physical device
- [x] Handle camera unavailability gracefully

### Image Handling
- [x] Add image quality optimization before upload
- [x] Handle different image orientations
- [x] Implement image resizing for large files
- [x] Add image validation and error handling

---

## Phase 6: Room Styling Integration üé®

- [ ] Implement style selection and preview
- [ ] Add real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Create seamless navigation flow

### Styling Workflow
- [ ] Integrate style options with backend
- [ ] Add custom prompt support
- [ ] Implement style preview functionality
- [ ] Create style comparison features

---

## Final Testing & Validation üß™

### Mobile Device Testing
- [ ] Test complete workflow on physical device
- [ ] Validate camera and gallery access
- [ ] Test notification delivery and interaction
- [ ] Verify image saving to photo library

### User Experience
- [ ] Test navigation flow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test offline/poor network conditions
- [ ] Ensure smooth performance on mobile

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
- [ ] Minimize memory usage during processing
- [ ] Reduce app bundle size
- [ ] Optimize network requests

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

### Core Functionality
- [x] User can take photo or select from gallery
- [ ] Image processes successfully with AI styling
- [ ] Processed image saves to device photo library
- [ ] User receives notification when processing complete
- [ ] All room types and styles work correctly

### User Experience
- [ ] Navigation is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Loading states are clear and informative
- [ ] Error handling is graceful and helpful
- [ ] App works reliably on mobile Expo Go

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] No test files or debug components in production
- [ ] Code is clean and well-documented
- [ ] Performance is optimized for mobile
- [ ] Error logging and monitoring in place

---

## Notes & Considerations

### Mobile Expo Go Limitations
- Camera and gallery access works in Expo Go
- Push notifications require Expo notification service
- File system access is limited to app sandbox
- Network requests must handle mobile data conditions

### Workflow Timing
- Expected processing time: 30-90 seconds
- Timeout handling after 2 minutes
- Progress updates every 5 seconds
- Fallback mechanisms for failed workflows

### Image Quality
- Input: High quality from camera/gallery
- Processing: Optimized for AI workflow
- Output: High quality for photo library
- Compression: Balanced quality vs file size

## üîß Latest Fixes
- **2024-12-27 HOTFIX**: Removed all remaining ImagePickerDebugScreen references from navigation files
- **2024-12-27 CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed bucket mismatch issue causing images not to return:
  - Updated N8N workflow to save processed images to `room-images/processed/` instead of `rooms/transformed/`
  - Enhanced `checkSupabaseForResults()` to check both new and legacy bucket locations
  - Added immediate photo library saving when processed images are found
  - Improved logging throughout the image processing and storage pipeline
  - Created automatic fallback to check multiple bucket locations for compatibility
