### Key Features

#### Room Images Utility (`app/utils/roomImages.ts`)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types for all room types and styles
- **Fallback System**: Uses placeholder images until real images are provided
- **Helper Functions**: Easy-to-use functions for getting room images
- **Display Names**: Human-readable names for UI display
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new room types or styles

### Usage Examples

```typescript
import { getRoomImage, getDefaultRoomImage, getAllRoomTypes, getAllStyles } from '../utils/roomImages';

// Get a specific room image
const bedroomImage = getRoomImage('bedroom', 'contemporary');

// Get default image for room selection
const defaultKitchen = getDefaultRoomImage('kitchen');

// Get all available options
const allRooms = getAllRoomTypes();
const allStyles = getAllStyles();
```

### Next Steps

1. **Provide Real Images**: Replace placeholder images with actual room photos
2. **Style Filtering**: Implement filtering by style in the rooms screen
3. **Room Templates**: Create pre-designed room templates for each style
4. **AI Integration**: Use room types and styles for AI-powered design suggestions

### Image Requirements

When you provide the actual room images, they should follow this structure:
```
app/assets/room-images/
├── {room-type}/
│   └── {style}/
│       ├── {style}-{room-type}-1.jpg
│       ├── {style}-{room-type}-2.jpg
│       └── {style}-{room-type}-3.jpg
```

For example:
```
app/assets/room-images/
├── bedroom/
│   ├── contemporary/
│   │   ├── contemporary-bedroom-1.jpg
│   │   ├── contemporary-bedroom-2.jpg
│   │   └── contemporary-bedroom-3.jpg
│   ├── scandinavian/
│   └── industrial/
└── kitchen/
    ├── contemporary/
    └── mediterranean/
```
